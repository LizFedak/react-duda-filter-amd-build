# About
This is a React application that utilizes the AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) module format for organizing and loading its components and code.

## Why AMD?

AMD is a module format that focuses on asynchronous loading of JavaScript modules, which can be beneficial in certain scenarios. While AMD is less common in modern React applications, there may be specific use cases where it aligns well with your project's requirements.

This was the specific format recommended for Duda's experimental React widget option, so I selected that.

Config files added/modified:

- .babelrc
- .postcss.config.js
- tailwind.config.js
- webpack.config.js

## Important Notes
The example React app uses AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) with Webpack for module loading and bundling.
Please note that this app is intended for testing and exploration purposes only. It is not meant for personal or business use beyond developer testing.
