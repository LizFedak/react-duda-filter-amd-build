# About
This is a work in progress. I'm using Duda's experimental feature to import a React app as the render for my custom widget. This uses create-react-app but has a lot of custom configurations in the webpack file.

If you are looking for an example, you can use this for TESTING but this is NOT available for any personal or business use beyond developer testing.
